          Einstein once mentioned, “Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.” We can completely agree with this great mathematician statement. It is the new experience and new exposures that teach you the new things. With every new fall, you learn something new. If you are not ready to let yourself fall, then you cannot teach yourself anything new. If you do not do that, you will continue to have bad experiences and it becomes a loop from which you can never get out. This leads to denial, losing self confidence and blaming others for your experiences. You enter into that stage of your life where you focus only on the negative impacts happening to you. Learning from your mistakes is not easy. Nobody said it was simple. But once you do, you can trust yourself. You believe that you have the power to do anything.

          You grow internally and externally when you realize your mistakes. You learn how to prevent the same mistakes from happening again. Some of our mistakes can bring us down and prove to be very dangerous. It may run us into a trap that seem to eat you up. Regardless of the mistake you made, you have to carefully observe and analyse the situation and take the necessary steps. This will highly the inner you and teach the others to look up to you.<br> 
          We all are humans. We make mistakes. But it is these mistakes that teach us.

        <h2>Section 1</h2>
        <p>
          Failures are the stepping stones to success. It is from those mistakes which makes us a better person and strive hard to our dream destination. Our mistakes teach us what went wrong and how to correct it. Each and every human has come across a phase in their life which they thought was their hardest part of their life. However, this particular phase taught them to become bigger and better. Everyone, at some point in their life, has made a mistake. Sometimes we get lucky and only falter a little, making it through the problem relatively intact. Other times, we mess up a lot and have to fix what was damaged over a long period of time. However, the same is true for most, if not all cases—those who make the mistake learn from it. Often times, our failures teach us valuable lessons that we only gained because of the experience we gathered after messing up. I have personally achieved a wealth of knowledge and experience just from all of my own little mishaps, and a few major ones.

        <h3>Section 2</h3>
        <p>Another turbulent time that taught me through failure was when I tried to arrange a birthday party for my sister. Everything was supposed to be arranged by me, so I went out a bought the invitation cards, party favors, balloons, decorations, food, and a few gifts. I filled out the invitations early and put them in a box to store them until I was ready to send them. Time flew by fast between daily life with my kids and responsibilities, and before I knew it the day of the party was upon me. Quickly that morning I decorated and cooked and prepared everything. As the hour of the party came and went, no one showed up but the birthday girl, whom I had called personally. Later it occurred to me that I hadn’t sent out the invitations! That was why no one had come. I soon learned from that mistake to be more organized and manage my time better when planning events.
